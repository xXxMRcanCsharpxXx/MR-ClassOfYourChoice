# Class of your Choice
Class of Choice is a Console App that allows a user to interact with a class of your choosing. You get to decide what you want to build! When your application is complete, you will have written a class that gives your object appropriate state and behavior, and a way for the user to interact with it.

## Setup
Spend some time thinking about the features your Class of Choice will have. Draw out a class diagram to identify your class's properties and methods.

Here are some ideas for classes, properties and methods. Use one of these ideas as a starting point, or make up your own:

- Book Class: track number of books read, keep list of favorite books, favorite genre, favorite author, keep a reading list, remove books from the list after they are read
- Grocery List Class: add a grocery item to the list, display your list, save grocery store name, grocery budget, amount spent at last grocery trip
- Recipe Class: save recipe name, list of ingredients, print ingredients to console, save cooking instructions, add ingredients, remove ingredients
- Car Service Class: car name, car year, next maintenance due, service needs, print info to console, days to next maintenance
- Football Game Class: home team, opponent name, home team record, opponent record, stadium name, game start time, home team quarterback, show info on screen, predict winner
- Cookie Order Class: cookie name, cookie description, number cookies ordered, cost per cookie, calculate total cost, delivery date, show days until delivery, show order details

## The Program Class
The Program Class has been provided for you, but it is empty. 

Start by thinking about your main menu options. What actions do you want the user to be able to take?

Instantiate your objects here in the Program class. Provide a nice user interface so the user can interact with your object(s). Put your interface in a loop so the user has control over how long they want to engage with your console app.

## Superhero Example
What do you want to do with your SuperHero?
1. Name them
2. Add to their list of powers
3. Use their power
4. Check their health level
5. Exit

Input: 3

Which power would you like to use?
1. Strength
2. Flying
3. Invisibility

Input: 2

Your SuperHero has used their Flying power.

(Do not use the superhero for your final submission)

## Your Class
Add a class file and name it after the object it represents. Add your properties, methods, and any constructors you may need to your class file.

## Your Tests Class
Writing tests for your class is optional, but encouraged.

## Grading
A Passing grade will be based on the following criteria:

- Your completed work has been pushed up to the GitHub Classroom repository before the deadline.
- Your console app compiles and runs without error.
- Tests are optional.
- You have added a class that includes the following:

   - at least 5 properties that are used within your application

   - at least 3 methods that are called within your application (NOTE: methods that Get or Set properties do not count toward the 3 method minimum)

   - An interface that allows the user to interact with all of an object's methods, and the option to continue interacting or exit.
